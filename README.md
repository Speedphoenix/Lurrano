Collect all the Christmas trees and reach the final room of the labyrinth

## Description
Radiant Maze is a maze that has an active color.  
Doors corresponding to that color are open, others are closed.  
You can persistently change the color by walking over pressure plates.  
You can temporarily change the color by activating a button. It will go back to the last persistent color after its duration has elapsed.  
Activating multiple buttons one after the other will enqueue the various temporary colors, and each will become active when the previous one runs out.

## Controls
- <kbd>z</kbd><kbd>q</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to move around
> You can change this to <kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> in the *controls* section of the main menu (bottom right)
- <kbd>e</kbd> to interact with buttons
- Left <kbd>Shift</kbd> to accelerate the speed at which the remaining temporary color decreases
- Use the mouse to look around

[//]: # (<kbd>Space</kbd> to jump)

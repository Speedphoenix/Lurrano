## Description
Radiant Maze is a maze that has an active color.  
Doors corresponding to that color are open, others are closed.  
You can persistently change the color by walking over pressure plates.  
You can temporarily change the color by activating a button. It will go back to the last persistent color after its duration has elapsed.  
Activating multiple buttons one after the other will enqueue the various temporary colors, and each will become active when the previous one runs out.
